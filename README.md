# gifRender

Welcome, you who wish to bear the mantle of the **Render of GIFs**!

### What does gifRender do? 

_gifRender_ is a simple GIF manipulator. It allows the user to create GIFs from a series of images,
while specifying parameters such as frame rate and image size. One may also 'rend' existing GIFs, splitting
them up into their component images for easy frame extraction. Additional features may include GIF editing and
file conversions. Let _gifRender_ fulfill all your gif needs!

### Who is gifRender for?

_gifRender_ avails itself to those who desire to create, rend, or otherwise manipulate GIFs.
Have a GIF that's just a tad too slow or fast? Like one particular frame of a GIF, but not the rest?
Want to make a GIF slideshow out of your family pictures?
Look no further than _gifRender_!

### Why gifRender?

I decided to create _gifRender_ as a natural continuation of [my previous project](https://github.com/VictorVy/myGallery),
a media gallery program equipped with a tagging system and search functionality. One of the planned features for this
project was a simple image, GIF, and/or video editing tool. It ended up falling outside the scope of the project,
so I decided this would be a good opportunity to create a new project that would focus on this feature, starting with GIFs.
