# gifRender

Welcome, you who wish to bear the mantle of the **Render of GIFs**!

### What does gifRender do? 

_gifRender_ is a simple GIF manipulator. It allows the user to create GIFs from a series of images,
while specifying parameters such as frame rate and image size. One may also 'rend' existing GIFs, splitting
them up into their component images for easy frame extraction. Additional features may include GIF editing and
file conversions. Let _gifRender_ fulfill all your gif needs!

### Who is gifRender for?
